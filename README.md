# Adopt A Pet NFT üêï | Warsaw ETH Hackathon 2024 Submission

## Introduction

Welcome to our **Tomagachi-style Pet NFT** project, built for the **Warsaw ETH Hackathon 2024**! This project brings together blockchain technology and the real-world mission of supporting pet shelters. With our on-chain solution, users can **adopt and care for virtual pets** submitted by real pet shelters, providing donations to these shelters in the process.

Our MVP showcases the potential to create a **meaningful social impact** rather than yet another meme token or trading app. By caring for your pet through the blockchain, every interaction benefits real-world shelters, each action being a micro-donation that goes to directly to care for the shelter animals.

## Project Vision üåü

The aim of this project is to give shelters a way to earn microdonations by allowing people to "adopt" pets in a gamified, on-chain environment. With the ever-growing popularity of NFTs, this platform turns the focus away from profit-driven motives to **social good** and tangible impact.

Each pet interaction (feeding, treating, and walking) translates to a **microdonation** that goes directly to the shelter. This means that users‚Äô care for their pets not only keeps them happy but also directly benefits the pet shelters financially.

If pets are neglected (i.e., not fed, treated, or walked within 7 days), they will be **returned to the shelter**, giving others a chance to adopt and ensure that these organizations receive continuous donations.

## Features

- **On-Chain Pet Adoption:** Adopt NFTs that represent real pets submitted by shelters.
- **Microdonations for Actions:** Every action you take (feeding, treating, walking) sends a small donation to the shelter.
- **Real-World Impact:** Unlike other meme-based projects, this NFT project is connected to real-world causes.
- **Multi-Chain Support:** You can adopt pets on multiple chains, including **Celo**, **Mantle**, **Aleph Zero**, **Optimism**, and **Starknet**.
- **On-Chain Metadata Preservation:** Pets and their metadata are stored on-chain, ensuring that pets and their history can be bridged across chains without losing any data.
- **Cross-Chain Bridging:** Move your pets between supported chains with seamless on-chain bridging, keeping all metadata intact.

## Why This Project Matters

Most blockchain-based projects today focus on trading and speculation, offering little to no real-world value. This project flips the narrative, showing how **decentralized technologies** can drive social good. Instead of swapping meme tokens, you‚Äôre interacting with a platform that supports **pet shelters** and drives donations to where they are needed most.

By combining blockchain with charitable giving, this platform could revolutionize the way donations and gamified experiences are structured, providing a fun, interactive, and impactful way for users to contribute to a cause.

## Multi-Chain Architecture üåê

Our platform is **multi-chain**, currently deployed on:
- **Celo**
- **Mantle**
- **Aleph Zero**
- **Optimism**
- **Starknet**

Users can easily **bridge** their pets between these chains, maintaining the same on-chain metadata and keeping track of their pet‚Äôs interactions and status.

## Tech Stack üíª

This project was built using **[Scaffold-ETH 2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2)**, which allowed us to rapidly develop a decentralized application (dApp) with all the essential tools to integrate smart contracts, a frontend UI, and cross-chain functionality.

## Future Development Plans üöÄ

Bounties won during this hackathon will be directly reinvested into **enhancing the platform**:
- **Expanding gamification**: We plan to add more game-like elements to increase user engagement while also boosting donations.
- **Advanced NFT features**: We will further develop the NFT aspects of the platform, possibly adding customization options, leveling systems, and more.
- **More chain integrations**: Expand to other EVM-compatible chains and L2 solutions to bring even more users and shelters onboard.
- **Broader shelter partnerships**: Collaborate with shelters globally to list more pets on-chain and drive even greater impact.

By pushing forward these improvements, we hope to turn this MVP into a full-fledged platform for **gamified donations** that continues to support the shelters long after the hackathon is over.

## Conclusion

Thank you for checking out our submission for the **Warsaw ETH Hackathon 2024**! Together, we can care for virtual pets while providing real-world help to those in need.

**Let‚Äôs bridge the gap between blockchain and social impact‚Äîone pet at a time!** üêï‚ù§Ô∏è
